PortFolio Website.
My project name is my PortFolio website.
In the website the user will be able to get to know me more. Such as my Education History, Work Experience, Past Projects and a way to Contact me.

Design Process.
This Website is for people employers to navigate easily through my website to see my information.
You will be able to see my wireframe in another file which i roughly mock up a design for the website.

Features.
Hovering over the logo will have an animation where another colour overlaps the logo.
Hovering over the navbar contents will also have an animation where another colour overlap them.
Clicking on the navbar will allow users to go to the specific content they chose.
