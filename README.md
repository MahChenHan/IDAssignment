PortFolio Website.
My project name is my PortFolio website.
In the website the user will be able to get to know me more. Such as my Education History, Work Experience, Past Projects and a way to Contact me.

Design Process.
This Website is for people employers to navigate easily through my website to see my information.
It is also to present myself in best light and get hired.
You will be able to see my wireframe in another file which i roughly mock up a design for the website.

Features.
Include educational history and work experience.
● Outline skills and any other relevant competencies and interests.
● Provide basic personal information and contact information for recruiters.
● Showcase portfolio of projects so far
Hovering over the logo will have an animation where another colour overlaps the logo.
Hovering over the navbar contents will also have an animation where another colour overlap them.
Clicking on the navbar will allow users to go to the specific content they chose.
Scrolling down will shrink the navbar however it will stay as a sticky.
When scrolling down at the bottom right there as a button for users to click which will make them go all the way back to the top.
There is an animation where "Welcome to my PortFolio Website" is seen as typing.
The Contact Me button when hover over will change border color.
Most image when click on will open another website.
The Footer "Instagram" and "LinkedIn" has website linked on it too.
When the footer are hover over a line will be drawn underneath it.

Testing.
1.Contact Form
i.Go to "Contact Me" Page
ii.Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
iii.Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
iv.Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

Some interesting bugs I have experience is mostly with the flexbox.
